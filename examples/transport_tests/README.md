# Sediment transport test cases

## Prescribed solid and solute transport

    include("PALEO_transport_sediment.jl")

Test solid and solute transport in sediment column with varying porosity.

## Multi-G particulate organic carbon transport and decay

    include("PALEO_transport_RCmultiG.jl")

Tests `ReactionRCmultiG` implementation of [Dale2015](@cite) discrete multi-G
representation of reactive-continuum particulate organic carbon. 

POC decay is added to DIC pool, includes d13C carbon isotopes.

Physical environment is from [Dale2015](@cite) 'shelf' and 'slope' cases.

## Solid transport calculated from volume change, "passive mud only" case

    include("PALEO_transport_mud.jl")

Test solid phase transport generated by adding passive mud M at the top of a sediment column with constant porosity,
check that this generates vertical advection at constant velocity.

## Solid transport calculated from volume change, with decaying Corg fraction

    include("PALEO_transport_mudCorg.jl")

Test solid phase transport generated by passive mud M and decaying Corg in a sediment column with constant porosity,
check that this generates vertical advection with a decrease in velocity with depth as the Corg pool decays.
